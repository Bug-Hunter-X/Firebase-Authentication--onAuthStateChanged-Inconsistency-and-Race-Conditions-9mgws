The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger if the user's session is interrupted or the network connection is unstable. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application, such as not updating the UI properly or failing to redirect to the appropriate screens.  Another issue is race conditions in asynchronous operations when managing authentication changes.
