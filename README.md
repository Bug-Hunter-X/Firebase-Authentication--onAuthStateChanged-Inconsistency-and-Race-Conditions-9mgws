# Firebase Authentication Bug: onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency and Race Condition Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The listener might not consistently trigger when unexpected events like network interruptions or session changes occur.  Additionally, handling asynchronous operations related to authentication can lead to race conditions.

## Bug Description:
The primary bug involves inconsistencies in the `onAuthStateChanged` listener. In certain scenarios, it doesn't always fire, leading to unexpected application behavior (e.g., UI not reflecting the authentication status).
Another problem occurs when there is a race between the `onAuthStateChanged` and other asynchronous actions that depend on the user's authentication status.  This race can produce unpredictable results.

## Solution:
The solution addresses the inconsistency by incorporating error handling and re-authentication attempts.  It also employs promises to handle asynchronous operations and eliminate race conditions.
